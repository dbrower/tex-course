\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
\item The files are on the graduate school's website at \url{http://graduateschool.nd.edu/resources-for-current-students/dt/dt-resources/}.
In the middle of the page is a view of a Box folder. Choose \textit{LaTeX (nddiss2e)}, and then download the file \textit{StandDistribution.zip}.
Unziping the file creates a directory \textit{StandDistribution} with five files inside:

\begin{itemize}
	\item nddiss2e.bst
	\item nddiss2e.cls
	\item nddiss2e.pdf
	\item nddiss2enoarticletitles.bst
	\item template.tex
\end{itemize}

\item The file \textit{nddiss2e.pdf} explains the options of the thesis class, e.g. how to make draft versions, final versions, the options for the title page, etc.

\item One difficulty of editing a large document is the time spent reprocessing each chapter after changes.
    If it makes sense for your work, I would recommend putting each chapter in its own file, or even its own directory.
    This is how I solved the problem.
    You may find a better solution, or perhaps your editor supports processing files independently.
    For example:

\begin{verbatim}
my-thesis/
    references.bib
    background
        only.tex
        background.tex
    stuff
        only.tex
        stuff.tex
    introduction.tex
    nddiss2e.bst
    nddiss2e.cls
    preamble.tex
    results
        only.tex
        results.tex
    thesis.tex
\end{verbatim}

The file \textit{preamble.tex} contains any shared definitions which I intend to use across the chapters.
(e.g. I defined the symbol \texttt{\\sss} which are three large stars so I can see places that I left incomplete.
\verb=\newcommand{\sss}{\ensuremath{\star\star\star}}=)

The main thesis is defined in the \textit{thesis.tex} file.
I set up the preamble, title, abstract, table of contents, and so on.
Then I include each chapter with code similar to the following

\begin{verbatim}
\chapter{BACKGROUND AND PRIOR WORK}
\label{ch:background}
\input{background/background}
\end{verbatim}

(N.b. Chapter titles in the thesis should be uppercased.)
Inside each chapter there are two files.
The main content is in one file, e.g. \textit{background.tex}.
I have a second file which wraps the content file so it can be processed by itself.

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}
\input{../preamble}
\begin{document}
\title{Background and prior work}
\maketitle
\input{background}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\end{document}
